Our project is a creative project which takes on storytelling through a digital media format. We took inspiration from the movie Searching(2018), which is about a father who finds clues about his daughterâ€™s disappearance on her laptop. We wanted to demonstrate that with this project, in which we mimic the styles of various social medias such as Twitter, Reddit, and text messages to tell a story through only online posts and messages. There's a lot of implied information that can be learned about people based on their usernames, the types of social media they use, and how they act online.
